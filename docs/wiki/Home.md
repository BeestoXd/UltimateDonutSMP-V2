# UltimateDonutSMP V2

One plugin for a DonutSMP-style survival network: money and shards, shops and auctions, homes
and RTP, duels / FFA / ranked PvP, crates, spawners, and staff tools — one database, one
config set.

**Must install first:** [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) and
[PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/). Without either, the
plugin disables itself.

**Java clients must be 1.21.6 or newer.** Minecraft 1.21.5 and older cannot render the Dialog API
menus (broken `/ah`, `/menu`, `/homes`, and similar). That is a Mojang client limit, not a plugin
bug — block those versions on the proxy or ViaVersion. See
[Dialog API & older clients](Dialog-API-and-Older-Clients).

`/billford` is listed in the jar but does nothing. Do not configure it. Details in the [FAQ](FAQ).
