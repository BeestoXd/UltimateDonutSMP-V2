# `rtp.yml`

Random teleport. The interesting part is that destinations are found ahead of time rather
than on demand: `RTPCacheTask` pre-scans and caches safe locations so `/rtp` can hand one
out instantly instead of freezing the server while it looks for solid ground.

`WORLD-SETTINGS` sets the search area and rules per world, `DENIED-WORLDS` blocks the rest,
and `QUEUE` handles the case where several players ask at once. Two permission families
modify behaviour per rank: `ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.cooldown.<seconds>` shortens the wait and
`ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.<N>` moves a player up the queue.

## Section: `SETTINGS`

General RTP settings

### Options

| Option path | Type | Accepted values | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.PLAYERS-IN-RTP` | `integer` | Any integer | `3` | Maximum number of players allowed to perform RTP simultaneously |
| `SETTINGS.MAX-ATTEMPTS` | `integer` | Any integer | `64` | Maximum safe location search attempts per RTP request |
| `SETTINGS.MAX-CHUNK-SAMPLES` | `integer` | Any integer | `128` | Maximum chunk samples to inspect while looking for a valid location |
| `SETTINGS.ATTEMPT-INTERVAL-TICKS` | `integer` | Any integer | `1` | Ticks between chunk samples |
| `SETTINGS.SEARCH-ATTEMPTS-PER-TICK` | `integer` | Any integer | `4` | Number of location attempts evaluated in parallel per sample interval |
| `SETTINGS.MIN-PLAYER-DISTANCE` | `integer` | Any integer | `2000` | Minimum horizontal blocks between the player and the RTP landing spot, in the same world. Radius below is measured from CENTER-X/Z, so without this a player already inside the ring can land a few hundred blocks away. 0 turns the check off. Per-world MIN-PLAYER-DISTANCE overrides this, and the value is capped at that world's MAX-RADIUS |
| `SETTINGS.SEARCH-DISPLAY-MIN-TICKS` | `integer` | Any integer | `0` | Ticks the searching display is held for before the teleport starts. Lower it to teleport sooner once a spot is found, 0 teleports the moment the search succeeds |
| `SETTINGS.FOUND-DISPLAY-TICKS` | `integer` | Any integer | `0` | Ticks the found location display is held for before the teleport is queued. This one is paid on every RTP, including one served from LOCATION-CACHE below. 0 teleports immediately |
| `SETTINGS.GENERATE-CHUNKS` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Generate new chunks while searching. Keep false for pregenerated RTP worlds to protect TPS |
| `SETTINGS.GENERATE-FALLBACK-CHUNKS` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Generate a limited number of chunks only after pregenerated/loaded RTP search cannot find a safe spot |
| `SETTINGS.GENERATE-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` | `integer` | Any integer | `32` | Chunk samples to try before limited fallback generation starts. Keep this high enough that a pregenerated world is searched before new terrain is generated, because generating is the wait after clicking RTP |
| `SETTINGS.MAX-GENERATE-FALLBACK-SAMPLES` | `integer` | Any integer | `32` | Maximum fallback chunks allowed to generate during one RTP search |
| `SETTINGS.LOAD-GENERATED-CHUNKS` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Allow loading already-generated chunks from disk if chunk generation is disabled. Turning this off with GENERATE-CHUNKS off as well leaves the search no way to reach a chunk |
| `SETTINGS.FALLBACK-TO-LOADED-CHUNKS` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | If random samples cannot be prepared, try already-loaded chunks as a fallback |
| `SETTINGS.LOADED-CHUNK-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` | `integer` | Any integer | `32` | Chunk samples to try before loaded chunk fallback starts |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-TELEPORT-CHUNKS` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Load the chunks around the destination before the teleport lands, so a player does not arrive in terrain the server has not read yet. Off teleports straight away and lets the client catch up on its own |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-RADIUS` | `integer` | Any integer | `2` | Chunk radius loaded around the destination, from 2 to 4. This is a floor rather than a cap: while POST-TELEPORT-CHUNK-THROTTLE is on, the throttled view distance below raises it, so on stock settings the radius is 4 whatever you put here |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-CHUNKS-PER-TICK` | `integer` | Any integer | `2` | Chunks loaded per tick while preloading. Values below 2 are treated as 2 |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-MAX-TICKS` | `integer` | Any integer | `40` | Give up preloading after this many ticks. Raised on its own when the radius and the per-tick rate above need longer than this to finish |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-CHUNK-THROTTLE` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Hold a player at a shorter view and simulation distance for a moment after an RTP, so the server is not sending a full render of brand new terrain all at once |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-VIEW-DISTANCE` | `integer` | Any integer | `4` | View distance to hold them at while the throttle is on. It only ever lowers a player's distance, never raises it, and values below 2 are treated as 2 |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-SIMULATION-DISTANCE` | `integer` | Any integer | `4` | Simulation distance to hold them at while the throttle is on. Same rules as above |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-THROTTLE-TICKS` | `integer` | Any integer | `80` | Ticks before the throttled distances are handed back. Values below 20 are treated as 20 |

### `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE`

Safe locations found ahead of time in the background so RTP can teleport without searching

#### Options

| Option path | Type | Accepted values | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.ENABLED` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enable the location cache. Locations are filled in the background while players are online so a click on RTP can teleport without searching |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.BACKGROUND-WARM-UP` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Keep false. The old join-time warm-up walked overworld/nether/end the moment the first player logged in and is what dropped TPS. The cache still fills a few seconds later |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.SIZE` | `integer` | Any integer | `3` | How many ready locations are kept per RTP world. 0 disables the cache |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.MAX-AGE-SECONDS` | `integer` | Any integer | `600` | Seconds a cached location stays usable before it is thrown away. 0 keeps it until the next reload |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.GENERATE-CHUNKS` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Let the background fill generate new terrain. Keep false. Loading already-generated chunks from disk (LOAD-GENERATED-CHUNKS) is enough to stock far RTP spots on a pregenerated world |

### `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE`

Priority queue settings for RTP requests

#### Options

| Option path | Type | Accepted values | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE.ENABLED` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enable or disable the RTP permission priority queue system |
| `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE.DEFAULT-PRIORITY` | `integer` | Any integer | `0` | Default priority for players without explicit priority permissions |

#### `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE.PERMISSIONS`

Explicit mapping from permission node to priority weight (higher = higher priority)

##### Options

| Option path | Type | Accepted values | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE.PERMISSIONS.ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.vip++` | `integer` | Any integer | `30` | Ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.vip++. |
| `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE.PERMISSIONS.ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.vip+` | `integer` | Any integer | `20` | Ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.vip+. |
| `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE.PERMISSIONS.ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.vip` | `integer` | Any integer | `10` | Ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.vip. |
| `SETTINGS.PRIORITY-QUEUE.PERMISSIONS.ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.high` | `integer` | Any integer | `5` | Ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.priority.high. |

### `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS`

Per-rank RTP cooldown overrides resolved from permissions

#### Options

| Option path | Type | Accepted values | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.ENABLED` | `boolean` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enable or disable permission based RTP cooldown overrides |

#### `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.PERMISSIONS`

##### Options

| Option path | Type | Accepted values | Default | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.PERMISSIONS.ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.cooldown.vip++` | `integer` | Any integer | `3` | Ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.cooldown.vip++. |
| `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.PERMISSIONS.ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.cooldown.vip+` | `integer` | Any integer | `10` | Ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.cooldown.vip+. |
| `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.PERMISSIONS.ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.cooldown.vip` | `integer` | Any integer | `15` | Ultimatedonutsmp2.rtp.cooldown.vip. |

## Section: `QUEUE`
