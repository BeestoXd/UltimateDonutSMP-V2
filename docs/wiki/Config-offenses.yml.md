# `offenses.yml`

The preset punishments staff pick from with `/offend`, and the escalating tiers each one
runs through. Rather than asking staff to judge a duration, they choose the offence and the
plugin applies the right tier based on how many times that player has done it before.

`durations` is that ladder: the first entry is the first offence, the second the second,
and the last entry repeats for every offence after it. A tier of `perm` never expires, and
a tier of `0s` is issued as a warning instead of a ban.

Treat `wipe: true` with care. It only fires when the offence actually bans someone, and it
clears that player's stats, balance, homes, ender chest, keys, auctions and orders — the
same thing `/playerwipe` does, with no undo. Punishment history, IP history and placed
spawners are kept.

Comment at the top of the shipped file:

```text
Configuration file for preset offenses and escalating punishment tiers.
Syntax per offense:
  <key>:
    name: "Display Name"
    type: BAN | MUTE | WARN | KICK
    wipe: false  # optional, defaults to false
    durations:
      - "30d"  # 1st offense
      - "60d"  # 2nd offense
      - "perm" # 3rd offense (and beyond)

wipe only fires when the offense actually bans someone. It clears their stats, balance, homes,
ender chest, crate keys, auctions, orders and the rest of their progress, the same thing
/playerwipe does, and there is no undo. Their punishment history, IP history and any spawners
they placed are kept. A tier of "0s" is issued as a warning rather than a ban, so it does not
wipe, and neither do MUTE, WARN or KICK offenses.
